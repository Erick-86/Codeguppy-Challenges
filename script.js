//UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
// i)   A set of numbers will be given
// i)   Calculate the sum of the numbers

//BREAKING THE PROBLEM INTO SUB-PROBLEMS
// i)   How to calculate the sum for a set of numbers

//SOLUTION
const sumOfSetOfNumbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
let sumOf = 0
for (let i = 0; i < sumOfSetOfNumbers.length; i++){
    sumOf = sumOf + sumOfSetOfNumbers[i] 
    console.log(sumOf)
}
//The current number is the sumOf = 0
//In the loop, the sumOf value changes to the sumOf + the current iteration until the loop is done
//Example: sumOf = 0 (current calue for the sumOf) + sumOfSetOfNumbers[2] (current value in the array) = 0 + 2 = 2
//         2 (the current value for sumOf) + sumOfSetOfNumbers[3] (current value in the array) = 2 + 3 = 5

//USING THE REDUCE() THE METHOD
const sum = sumOfSetOfNumbers.reduce((x, y) => x + y);
console.log(sum);
